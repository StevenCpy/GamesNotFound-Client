# GamesNotFound-Client
Personal project, definitely not a knock-off of Steam

Implementation of very basic Steam features in my own way

Development START DATE: Feb 15, 2026

If you're an employer, please see dev-journal if you're interested to see my progress and my notes during development.

To run code locally, "npm run dev".  This is a Vite project.

My code contains no AI-generated code.  I only used LLMs for general questions, for example "Best practice for src vs public folder?" or "How to iterate through components using map?"
