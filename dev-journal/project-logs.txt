Day 1 - Feb 15, 2026
- Created Vite project.
- Created main navigation bar containing Home and Store pages.

What I learned today:
- From Vite, Parcel and rsbuild, do not use Parcel.  Vite is industry-standard but rsbuild is faster.
- To create Vite project, use "npm create vite@latest ." with JavaScript + React Compiler flag.  To run use "npm run dev".
- main.jsx vs App.jsx.  main.jsx is app entry point and App.jsx contains logic and structure.  main.jsx rarely modified.

Day 2 - Feb 17, 2026
- Created StoreGame component to hold info about each game

What I learned today:
- Component function takes only 1 parameter which is an array, i.e. func({ param1, param2 }) instead of func(param1, param2)
- props are arguments in React and passed as follows: <StoreGame gameName="myFirstGame" gameVersion="1.0" />
- Component names use PascalCase.  HTML elements use lowercase.
- Displaying children using map() requires a unique key for each child.  For eg. <StoreGame key="1", gameName="myFirstGame" gameVersion="1.0" />

Day 3 - Feb 18, 2026
- Added game cover image to games.

What I learned today:
- public vs src folder.  public/ for files that are served as is while src/ for files tied to components, are optimized by the build tool and can be imported into code.
For game cover images, better use public/ to reduce bundle size.
