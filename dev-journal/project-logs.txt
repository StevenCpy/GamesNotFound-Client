Day 1 - Feb 15, 2026
- Created Vite project.

What I learned today:
- From Vite, Parcel and rsbuild, do not use Parcel.  Vite is industry-standard but rsbuild is faster.
- To create Vite project, use "npm create vite@latest ." with JavaScript + React Compiler flag.  To run use "npm run dev".
- main.jsx vs App.jsx.  main.jsx is app entry point and App.jsx contains logic and structure.  main.jsx rarely modified.
