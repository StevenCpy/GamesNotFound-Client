Day 1
- Created Vite project.
- Created main navigation bar containing Home and Store pages.

What I learned today:
- From Vite, Parcel and rsbuild, do not use Parcel.  Vite is industry-standard but rsbuild is faster.
- To create Vite project, use "npm create vite@latest ." with JavaScript + React Compiler flag.  To run use "npm run dev".
- main.jsx vs App.jsx.  main.jsx is app entry point and App.jsx contains logic and structure.  main.jsx rarely modified.

Day 2
- Created StoreGame component to hold info about each game

What I learned today:
- Component function takes only 1 parameter which is an array, i.e. func({ param1, param2 }) instead of func(param1, param2)
- props are arguments in React and passed as follows: <StoreGame gameName="myFirstGame" gameVersion="1.0" />
- Component names use PascalCase.  HTML elements use lowercase.
- Displaying children using map() requires a unique key for each child.  For eg. <StoreGame key="1", gameName="myFirstGame" gameVersion="1.0" />

Day 3
- Added game cover image to games.

What I learned today:
- public vs src folder.  public/ for files that are served as is while src/ for files tied to components, are optimized by the build tool and can be imported into code.
For game cover images, better use public/ to reduce bundle size.
- inline style field does not need quotes.  "display":"flex" works same as display:"flex"
<div style={{
    display:"flex",
    flexDirection: "column"
}}>

Day 4
- Merged backend and frontend into single repo.

What I learned today:
- Whitespace inside tags don't matter, and there's white space collapsing between text elements (i.e. only 1 whitespace counts).

Day 5
- Added login link.

What I learned today:
- 3 ways to share variables:
    1. file containing global variables.  Disadv: Updating variable value will not trigger UI update, as opposed to using useState().
    2. lift state up.  Disadv: Prop drilling - Need to pass variables to child components, which is very bad for components with many nested intermediate children.
    3. use context.
- Center an element using marginLeft: "auto" and marginRight: "auto".
- Import browserRouter, routes, route in App.jsx but import Link in pages that use links.
- <div> vs <span>: <div> stacks elements vertically while <span> stacks elements horizontally.

Day 6
- Added login and sign up pages.
- Added logic to sign up button.
- Added persistent message when signed up successful.

What I learned today:
- In button's onClick props, use handleClick instead of handleClick() as handleClick() runs the function immediately, returning the value of the function.
- use e.preventDefault() to prevent form from reloading when submitting.
